## Source Code
The simulator used in this project utilizes the Ignition Gazebo simulator as the base, with a number of custom PlugIns developed by this project to implement specific features needed to simulate this WEC.  Ignition Gazebo and this projects plugins are open source projects and the source code for these can be accessed at [https://github.com/gazebosim/gz-sim](https://github.com/gazebosim/gz-sim) and [https://github.com/osrf/buoy_entrypoint](https://github.com/osrf/buoy_entrypoint).  Documentation in these respositories is intended for developers but does provide some detailed information about how the simulation works.
