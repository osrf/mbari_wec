# Buoy Interfaces (ROS 2 Messages)

Several ROS 2 messages/services have been defined in the
[buoy_interfaces](https://github.com/osrf/mbari_wec_utils/tree/v2.0.0-rc1/buoy_interfaces) package to
access telemetry and send commands.

For more information about ROS 2 interfaces, see
[docs.ros.org](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Concepts/About-ROS-Interfaces.html).
