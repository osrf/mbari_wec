# Theory

## Modeling Technique Overview
The numerical modeling used in this simulator relies upon the Gazebo simulators ability to solve for the 
motion of a collection of rigid bodies connected by various types of joints.  Gazebo can use several 
different physics solvers to perform this solution, and the wave-energy buoy simulator in this project
uses the <a href="https://dartsim.github.io/") target="_blank">DART</a> physics engine.  The physics engine
solves the multi-body six degree-of-freedom problem for the motion of the connected buoy, power-take-off device, and heave cone,
subject to initial conditions and forces that act on the various components as the simulation progresses.  In the Gazebo simulator,
these forces are provided by plugin code that applies forces to each body based on the state (position and velocity) of each
component in the system at each timestep.  

The Gazebo simulator already includes several plugins that provide relevant forces such as buoyancy and hydrodynamic drag. 
Additionally, several additional plugins have been created for this simulator that provide the forcings on the system
due to the electro-hydraulic power-take-off system, the pneumatic spring system, the tether connecting the PTO to the
heave-cone, the mooring system that anchors the system, and the forcing on the buoy from the ocean surface waves. 
The sections below outline some details about how each of these forcings are modelled and computed.  First however, 
the specific physical characteristics of the MBARI WEC are tabulated for reference.

## Physical Characteristics

Each rigid body in the simulation has a "Link Frame" coordinate system in which all other characteristics of the
body are defined in for computational purposes.  This link-frame coordinate system is often selected to be at the
location of a joint that connects the various bodies (which are also called links in the vernacular of Gazebo).
Also, the description below includes alternative notation for added mass, e.g.  \(\\ \mu_{xx}\), in the style of Newman.

#### Model

Under compression and expansion, the pressure, volume and temperature of the Nitrogen in each
chamber evolves according to Ideal Gas Law:

$$ P V = m R_{specific} T $$

and a polytropic process:

$$ P = P_0 \left({V_{0} \over V}\right)^{n} $$

with hysteresis, there are two values for the polytropic index, \(n_1\) and \(n_2\), to capture behavior when
the gas is compressing or expanding. Using this quasi-static solution and
discrete time steps, and also incorporating hysteresis, the process becomes:

$$ V_k = x_k A_{piston} + V_{dead} $$
$$
P_k = P_{k-1} \left({V_{k-1} \over V_k}\right)^n ,\,\,\, n = \begin{cases}
    n_1 & \text{if } v \ge 0 \\
    n_2 & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
$$
$$ T_k = {P_k V_k \over m R_{specific}} $$

where \(k\) is the current time step.

Whenever the piston velocity is slow enough, the process is dominated by heat loss and
modeled with Newton's Law of Cooling (using forward difference) followed by an update of pressure using
Ideal Gas Law:

$$ T_k = r\, \Delta t\, (T_{env} - T_{k-1}) + T_{k-1} $$
$$ V_k = x_k A_{piston} + V_{dead} $$
$$ P_k = {m R_{specific} T_k \over V_k} $$

The mass of the Nitrogen in each chamber is determined from inputs in the SDF:

$$ m = {P_0 (x_0 A_{piston} + V_{dead}) \over R_{specific} T_0} $$

and is used for mass flow between chambers in simulating the pump/valve.


#### Determining Parameter Values

Linear regression was used to determine the polytropic indices for each chamber using empirical
data from the physical system. Using pressure vs volume curves, \(n_1\) is determined from
increasing volume, and \(n_2\) is determined from decreasing volume. The data is then preconditioned
by taking the logarithm to linearize and perform regression to find the parameters. For a
polytropic process:

$$ P V^{n} = C $$

so,

$$ \log{P} + n \log{V} = \log{C} $$
$$
\left[ { \begin{array}{cc}
    \log{\bf V} & 1 \\
\end{array} } \right] \left[ { \begin{array}{c}
    -n \\
    \log{C} \\
\end{array} } \right] = \log{\bf P}
$$

in block matrix notation where \({\bf V}\) and \({\bf P}\) are the arrays of volume and pressure data, respectively.
The other parameters in the system are taken from CAD or empirically determined by comparing logged
data from prescribed motion between simulation and the physical test bench.
