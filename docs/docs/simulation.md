A computer simulation environment has created that  that emulates the ROS 2 messages  used on the buoy system, and connects them to a numerical simulation of the system dynamics and behavior of the electro-hydraulic Power-Take-Off device.  The aim of this simulation is to provide a computer based simulation that for most behaviors, interacts with computer code in the same way the physical buoy system does.  The aim is that code running on a desktop Linux machine can run unchanged on the physical buoy, and that the response of the simulated buoy is indistinguishable from the real system.  The following sections provide some details of this simulator, and additional details are in the  [theory](theory.md)  section.
