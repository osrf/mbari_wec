# ROS 2 Messages and Services

Working with the simulator as well as the physical buoy can be done
through ROS 2 messages and services. There are also API classes for
both C++ and Python available.

A detailed list of ROS 2 messages and services can be found in
[ROS 2 Interface->Interfaces (ROS 2 Messages)](../../ROS2/messages.md).

Python API class documentation can be found in
[ROS 2 Interface->API (Python)](../../ROS2/python_api.md).

C++ API class documentation can be found in
[ROS 2 Interface->API (C++)](../../ROS2/cpp_api.md).

## Getting Started (Tutorial Series)

The following tutorials will help with getting started writing control code
for the buoy:

- [Controller GitHub Template (Python)](PythonTemplate.md)
- [Controller GitHub Template (C++)](CppTemplate.md)
