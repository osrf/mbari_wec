## ROS 2 Message

While running, the simulator generates exactly the same ROS 2 messages that the buoy hardware does during operation.  These are grouped into ROS 2 topics that corresponds to data being produced by each micro-controller or instrument on the buoy.  To see all ROS 2 topics being published to on the system, issue the following command (after sourcing the workspace if needed in a new terminal ``` $ . ~/buoy_ws/install/setup.sh```

``` 
$ ros2 topic list 
/ahrs_data
/clock
/joint_states
/parameter_events
/power_data
/rosout
/spring_data
/tf
/tf_static
/xb_imu
```

The topics /ahrs_data, /battery_data, /spring_data, /power_data, and /heavecone_data corresponds to the buoy-based instrumentation (AHRS), battery controller, spring controller, power-converter controller, and heave-cone controller.  Several of these topics are only available in simulation, and only /ahrs_data, /battery_data, /spring_data, /power_data, and /heavecone_data will be present on the real buoy.


To see the data being published in these topics, issue the following command and the data will scroll by, for example:

```
$ ros2 topic echo power_data

The data in each topic corresponds to the message descriptions which can be seen here along with a description of each field.

The next tutorial "[View Messages with Plotjuggler](SimulatorOutputPlotjuggler.md)" shows how to conveniently plot these data items while the simulator is running.
